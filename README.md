# SQL-cheat-sheet

##Overview
	Everytime I have an interview comming up where I think
   	the interviewer is going to ask me SQL related
    questions, I spend two or three days reviewing all of
    SQL.
    
    I am tired of that approach! I am going to create a
    cheat sheet for all future use!
